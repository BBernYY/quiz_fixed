# quiz_fixed
 
unfinished project; I believe the idea was to create a buzzfeed quiz inspired system that asks the user some array of questions and then asks for the answer that the test is to give (ex: do you like apples? , do you like oranges? , do you like bananas? |You are n% likely to like fruit. |end: do you actually like fruit?) By asking the actual question at the end the system will update itself based on the given answers in a way analogous to backpropagation in AI-systems.
